Jupyter Notebooks can be distributed as individual files/URLs with the name of the docker image it needs to be reproduced consistently. nbreproduce will create a new notebook with the suffix -reproduce.ipynb in the current directory. To check the outputs you can open the reproduced notebooks using your favourite notebook frontend, JupyterLab/nteract/VSCode/PyCharm... Local Notebooks You can reproduce local notebooks by linking a docker image which is requried to build the environment. $ nbreproduce --docker DOCKER_IMAGE name_of_notebook.ipynb You wouldn't have to provide the DOCKER_IMAGE option after the first run as it is saved inside the notebook metadata (look for the tag name docker_image ). If you share this notebook users wouldn't need to use --docker DOCKER_IMAGE while reproducing the notebook. To reproduce a notebook which already has a docker_image tag in the metadata of the notebook. $ nbreproduce name_of_notebook.ipynb URL Notebooks NOTE: This currently only works with GitHub URL links and docker images on DockerHub. nbreproduce can be used in combination with a GitHub link of a Jupyter Notebook with a linked docker image. To fetch a notebook and run it inside a docker container: $ nbreproduce --docker DOCKER_IMAGE --url LINK_TO_URL As an example to test if everything works locally you can test with a sample notebook hosted at https://github.com/econ-ark/nbreproduce/blob/master/tests/hello_world.ipynb . $ nbreproduce --docker jupyter/scipy-notebook:latest --url https://github.com/econ-ark/nbreproduce/blob/master/tests/hello_world.ipynb","title":"Reproduce - Notebooks"},{"location":"projects/#reproduce-notebooks","text":"You can use nbreproduce to execute individual Jupyter notebooks locally on your machine inside a docker environment.

(Just like a make file) The only requirement is to have an entry bash script which contains all the required steps to reproduce the project. An example bash script could be something like: # clean data python clean_data.py # generate figure python generate_figures.py # build latex paper pdflatex latex/paper.tex nbreproduce mounts the current directory inside a docker container created using the docker image name provided. To reproduce a project with a docker image and bash script: $ nbreproduce --docker DOCKER_IMAGE name_of_bash_script.sh nbreproduce by default looks for a bash script with the name reproduce.sh . If the bash script is reproduce.sh then just providing the name of the docker image is enough to execute nbreproduce in the current directory. $ nbreproduce --docker DOCKER_IMAGE By default the docker image points to econark/econ-ark-notebook:latest which builds on top of jupyter/scipy-notebook by adding latex and econ-ark .
